 * release a node that is not the head (a node located
 * farther down the chain, to the 'right' of the head
 * node), how can we set the next pointer of its previous
 * node to NULL? We cannot set this pointer to NULL
 * because we do not have the address of the preceding node
 * (the one to the 'left' from `lst`). Therefore, the only
 * way to use this function is to free the entire list,
 * starting from the head node (`lst` == `head`) */
